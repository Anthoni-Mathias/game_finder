    Historically, the term "gamer" or "gameplayer" refers to someone who plays role-playing games, (RPG). Or miniature games classified as gamer. However, more recently the term has grown to include video game players, The word "gamer" referring to the gamer has gained traction entering the PC community initially with the popularization of MMORPG games like EVE Online (2001) on PC , A massively multiplayer online role-playing game (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game) or MMORPG is a game genre that allows a group of players to create characters in a dynamic online virtual world. MMORPGs are a fusion of Massively Multiplayer Online Game ("Multiplayer Online Games") and RPGs ("Character Role Playing Games"). The term "gamer" was initially used to differentiate these players from simple people who played ''casually'' taking into account that MMORPG players spent hours ''playing'' with total immersion in the game, having a high knowledge of tactics, techniques, updates and about the platform they use, different from casual gamers.

    There are many gaming communities around the world mainly in the United States. Many of these take the form of webrings, discussion forums and other virtual communities, as well as college and university social clubs. Specialty gaming stores often serve as meeting places for organizing groups of players and also as a chat room.[citation needed] Before the emergence of the Internet, there were many developed PBeM communities that resemble today's online games. .[citation needed]

    In October 2006, the Entertainment Consumers Association (ECA) was established as the first nonprofit membership organization formed to represent American consumers. A similarly named entity, the Entertainment Software Association (ESA), was formed in 1994 to represent the entertainment software industry. The ECA was formed, in part, in response to apparently unbalanced representation (eg, the ESA, IGDA, and others) of gambling in the US Congress.[1]
